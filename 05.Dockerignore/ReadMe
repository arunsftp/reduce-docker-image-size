As a rule, only the necessary files need to be copied over the docker image.

Docker can ignore the files present in the working directory if configured in the .dockerignore file.

It also improves caching by ignoring unnecessary files and prevents unnecessary cache invalidation.

This feature should be kept in mind while optimizing the docker image.
